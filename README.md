***Introduction***

This repository contains the code, data, and finished product of a data science driven project I completed about a month ago.
This project focuses on trying to figure out a new way to rank NBA players based on their statistical interactions with one another. 
In this file you will find one file of Raw data, two files of cleaned data (Player and Assist.xlsx), two files of R-code (.Rmd), a powerpoint presentation and a pdf file.

***How to view the data and code***

To view the data, ensure that you have microsoft excel.
You can view the code three seperate ways. 

First, You can download R and then Rstudio (see https://www.r-project.org/).

Second, You can download Anaconda and use the built in R add-on (see https://www.anaconda.com/download).

Third, You can download VS code (or an equivalent, https://code.visualstudio.com/download ). 

***Final Comments***

Also attached in this repo is a powerpoint presentation as well as the Final Paper that I wrote. You can simply click and download these to view them.
If you enjoy the NBA and are interested in the topic of ranking players than this is the project for you!
